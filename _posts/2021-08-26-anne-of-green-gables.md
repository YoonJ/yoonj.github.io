I've been thinking over the idea until I've got kind of used to it. It seems a sort of duty. I've never brought up a child, especially a girl, and I dare say I'll make a terrible mess of id. But I'll do my best. So far as I'm concerned, Metthew, she may stay."

> "You'd find it easier to be bad than good if you had red hair,"

> I foresee that I shall have my hands full. Well, well, we can't get through this world without our share of trouble. I've had a pretty easy life of it so far, but my time has come at last and I suppose I'll just have to make the best of it.
